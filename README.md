# Screendrop Worker

The cloud backend for [Screendrop](https://github.com/fayazara/screendrop), an open-source native macOS screenshot tool. This worker handles uploading, storing, and sharing screenshots and screen recordings via shareable links.

Built with [Hono](https://hono.dev) on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), using [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) for file storage and [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) for metadata.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/fayazara/screendrop-worker)

## How it works

1. The Screendrop macOS app captures a screenshot or screen recording
2. The file is uploaded to this worker (either via multipart form or streaming upload)
3. The worker stores the file in R2 and creates a metadata row in D1
4. A shareable link is returned (e.g. `https://your-worker.workers.dev/a1b2c3d4`)
5. Anyone with the link sees a clean viewer page with download, copy link, and copy image actions

## Deploy

Click the button above to deploy to your Cloudflare account. The deploy flow will:

- Clone this repo into your GitHub account
- Automatically provision an R2 bucket and D1 database
- Prompt you to set an `UPLOAD_TOKEN` secret (choose a secure token and save it — you'll need it in the Screendrop app)
- Deploy the worker and set up CI/CD via Workers Builds

Once deployed, open the Screendrop app settings, go to the **Cloud** tab, and paste your worker URL and upload token.

### Manual setup

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fayazara/screendrop-worker.git
cd screendrop-worker
npm install

# Set your upload token as a secret
wrangler secret put UPLOAD_TOKEN

# Deploy (auto-provisions R2 + D1, then applies migrations)
npm run deploy
```

## API

All API routes are CORS-enabled. Routes marked with a lock require a Bearer token (`UPLOAD_TOKEN`).

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/ping` | Bearer | Connection health check |
| `POST` | `/api/upload` | Bearer | Multipart file upload |
| `PUT` | `/api/upload` | Bearer | Streaming upload (raw bytes, metadata via headers) |
| `POST` | `/api/register` | Bearer | Register metadata for a file already uploaded to R2 |
| `GET` | `/api/media/:id` | Public | Serve raw file from R2 |
| `GET` | `/:id` | Public | Image/video viewer page with OG tags |

### Upload (multipart)

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@screenshot.png" \
  -F "width=1920" \
  -F "height=1080"
```

### Upload (streaming)

For large files. The request body is the raw file — no buffering in Worker memory.

```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
  -H "X-Filename: screenshot.png" \
  -H "X-Width: 1920" \
  -H "X-Height: 1080" \
  --data-binary @screenshot.png
```

### Response

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "url": "https://your-worker.workers.dev/a1b2c3d4",
  "filename": "screenshot.png",
  "size": 204800
}
```

## Configuration

### Secrets

Set via `wrangler secret put`, or prompted automatically during the Deploy to Cloudflare flow (defined in `.dev.vars.example`):

| Secret | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `UPLOAD_TOKEN` | Shared token for authenticating uploads from the Screendrop app | Yes |
| `AUTHOR_NAME` | Display name shown on shared pages (falls back to `Anonymous`) | No |
| `AUTHOR_AVATAR` | Avatar URL shown on shared pages (falls back to a generated avatar) | No |

### Bindings (auto-provisioned)

| Type | Binding | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| R2 | `BUCKET` | File storage for screenshots and recordings |
| D1 | `DB` | SQLite database for upload metadata |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a local dev server at `http://localhost:5173` with hot reload. Local R2 and D1 resources are created automatically and persist between runs.

### Database migrations

```bash
# Apply migrations locally
npm run db:migrate:local

# Apply migrations to production
npm run db:migrate:remote
```
